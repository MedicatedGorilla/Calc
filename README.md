# Calc
JS Calculator

This is a basic calculator built in js. It uses flexbox to arrange the buttons and is capable of continuous input and operations much like you would find on a phone caclulator. It is a bit of a copy/paste nightmare at the moment but in terms of how it works, looks aside, I think it works well.
